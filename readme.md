**Online Library Search Assistant** <br>
This is my first attempt in a frontend project.
An interactive web application that allows users to search for books and research materials using keywords. It integrates with the Google Books API and Open Library API to provide diverse results. The app features a modern dark theme with a purple color scheme and includes pagination for better user experience.<br>
